- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (60,000 images)
- **Accuracy**: 95.2%
- **Training Time**: 4 hours on GPU

![Training Results](https://example.com/training-graph.png)

## Code Repository

Check out the full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyohn55/ai-classifier).

## Next Steps

I'm planning to deploy this as a web app using Flask. Stay tuned for updates!
