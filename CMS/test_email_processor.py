This is a test email to verify that the email-to-portfolio system is working correctly.

**How it works:** This test email should create a new web page and add a tile to the Research section of the homepage.

[Description]This is a test email to verify the email-to-portfolio system functionality.[/Description]

The system should:
1. Parse this email content
2. Generate a new HTML page in the Pages/ directory  
3. Add a research tile to the homepage
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub

If you can see this as a webpage with a corresponding tile, the system is working!
