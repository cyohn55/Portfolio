Subject: Machine Learning Projects

# Machine Learning Journey

I've been working on several machine learning projects that showcase my skills in data science and artificial intelligence.

## Current Projects

### 1. Image Classification with TensorFlow
I developed a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieves 85% accuracy and demonstrates my understanding of:
- Deep learning architectures
- Computer vision techniques
- Model optimization and hyperparameter tuning

### 2. Natural Language Processing
Created a sentiment analysis model using Python and NLTK that can classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. This project involved:
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM)

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
Built a comprehensive data analysis pipeline using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to analyze customer behavior data. The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly

## Technical Skills

My machine learning toolkit includes:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, AWS SageMaker
- **Techniques**: Supervised/Unsupervised learning, Deep Learning, NLP

## Future Goals

I'm excited to explore:
- Reinforcement learning applications
- Computer vision for autonomous systems
- Large language models and transformers
- Edge AI and mobile machine learning

This journey in machine learning has taught me the importance of both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. Every project is an opportunity to learn new techniques and solve real-world problems.
