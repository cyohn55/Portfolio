# Space Bar Shortcut for Accepting Run Requests

## Quick Accept with Space Bar

When the AI proposes terminal commands or other executable requests, you can quickly accept them by pressing the **space bar** instead of clicking the accept button.

## Usage

1. AI proposes a command to run
2. Press **Space Bar** to accept and execute
3. Press **Escape** or click "Reject" to decline

## Benefits

- **Faster workflow**: No need to reach for the mouse
- **Keyboard-driven**: Keeps hands on keyboard for efficient coding
- **Quick iteration**: Rapidly accept and test AI suggestions

## When This Applies

- Terminal command proposals
- Code execution requests
- File operation confirmations
- Any pending action that requires user approval
