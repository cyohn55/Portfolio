<p><strong>Why do Boolean functions play a central role in hardware architectures?</strong></p>
    <p>According to Nisan and Schocken (2005), "Since computer hardware is based on the representation and manipulation of binary values, Boolean functions play a central role in the specification, construction, and optimization of hardware architectures. Hence, the ability to formulate and analyze Boolean functions is the first step toward constructing computer architectures." (p. 8)</p>
    <p>To better understand 'why' Boolean functions play a critical role in hardware architecture, it's important to describe the interaction between physical hardware and binary electrical states (i.e., no electricity or full electrical current). Mechanical metal gates were initially used in computers. The gates would snap closed to complete the circuit, allowing electricity to flow freely. Conversely, opening the gate would break the flow of electricity. (CrashCourse et al., 2017). These two states, on and off, electrical current or no current, could be easily mapped 1:1 to the binary values zero and one. Additionally, the physical implementation of these mechanical gates could be used to represent the abstract concept called positional notation using the Base 2 system, also known as Binary Notation. According to Cisco Networking Academy (2022), "Positional notation means that a digit represents different values depending on the position the digit occupies. In a positional notation system, the number base is called the radix. In the base ten system, the radix is 10. In the binary system, we use a radix of 2." (para. 5). With eight bits or eight positions to work with, we could represent the numbers 0 through 255.</p>
    <p>With each new layer of abstraction, we could represent additional functionality without having to worry about the functionality of the underlying systems. Nisan and Schocken (2005) give an example of this behavior when describing the Nand and Nor functions by saying, "The Nand function (as well as the Nor function) has an interesting theoretical property: Each one of the operations And, Or, and Not can be constructed from it, and it alone (e.g., x Or y =(x Nand x) Nand (y Nand y). And since every Boolean function can be constructed from And, Or, and Not operations using the canonical representation method, it follows that every Boolean function can be constructed from Nand operations alone. This result has far-reaching practical implications: Once we have in our disposal a physical device that implements Nand, we can use many copies of this device (wired in a certain way) to implement in hardware any Boolean function." (p. 10)</p>
    <p>Now that we had a one-to-one representation of the physical and mathematical concepts working in concert, we could design computers of greater complexity. Boolean functions could check the validity of a system design before it was implemented in its physical form. Today's systems designers use virtual Hardware Description Language, or HDL, to build theoretical systems without building a single chip. In turn, computer systems designers were able to reduce research and design costs since they could ensure the design works mathematically before building the system.</p>

<p><strong>What are Composite Gates?</strong></p>
    <p>Primitive gates like And, Or, and Not are considered primitive because they are some of the simplest implementations of logic gates. However, if we chain together different configurations of And, Or, and Not, we can create systems of greater complexity and functionality. Essentially, a composite gate is a gate made up of other gates. We don't need to know how the primitive gates work under the hood of the composite gate; we just need the composite gate to behave as expected. The concept is similar to the concept of object-oriented programming. In programming, we create objects with a single or narrowly defined purpose so we can compartmentalize our code into individual objects. This makes debugging easier, and modularity means our code can be reused and moved without affecting the rest of the system. Primitive and Composite gates are just the hardware implementation of this modular design philosophy.</p>

<p><strong>Describe Multiplexors and Demultiplexors. What is the importance of the use of the selection bit and the data bits?</strong></p>
    <p>Nisan and Schocken (2005) describe the functionality of the Multiplexor by saying, "The name multiplexor was adopted from communications systems, where similar devices are used to serialize (multiplex) several input signals over a single output wire." (p. 20). Put simply, a multiplexor is a gate that takes three inputs, the selection bit and two data bits, and returns one of the two data bits depending on the value of the selection bit. Multiplexors can also be larger in complexity and accept more than three inputs, and hold more data bits.</p>
    <p>The inverse of a Multiplexor is a Demultiplexor. Where the Multiplexor takes three inputs and gives one output, a demultiplexor takes a single input and returns one of two possible outputs depending on the value of the selection bit. Demultiplexors can also be built with greater complexity as well.</p>
    <p>The selection and data bits are important in Multiplexors and Demultiplexors because they add a logic component to the gate beyond the simple 0 for off and 1 for on. The selection bit is similar to the concept of a pointer in programming. The selector points to the correct data bit to be used for output, or in the case of a Demultiplexor, the correct path to output the data bit through.</p>
