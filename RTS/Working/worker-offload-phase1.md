# Phase 1 — Flip the worker switch

Goal: run the deterministic simulation in a Web Worker. Phase 0 made this
**mechanical** by forcing every write through `dispatchCommand` (one funnel) and
every read through `getSimSnapshot()` (one seam), with the boundary guarded
(`snapshot-boundary.guard.mjs`) and the sim's mirror fields derived main-thread
(`syncLocalPilotMirror` / `syncLocalSelectionMirror`). Phase 1 swaps the two ends of
those seams from in-thread calls to worker messages.

The work splits into one **prerequisite** (a real sim behaviour decision that can't
be deferred), then the migration proper in **safe increments** — each
behaviour-neutral and gated by the existing harness suite.

## P1-PRE — DONE (2026-06-28). Sever the last sim READ of a Bucket-C field

**Resolved with option (A)** (user decision): single-player movement-priority now derives
from `unitOrders`, identical to lockstep — `movementPriorityIds = new Set(Object.keys(
draft.unitOrders))` at `state.ts:~1473`. The sim no longer reads ANY Bucket-C field.
Behaviour change: a *selected but order-less* unit (e.g. a piloted monarch) no longer gets
make-way priority until it has an active order.
- **Verification:** `tsc` + `vite build` clean; the relative-comparison harnesses
  (dispatch-equivalence, two-peer, pilot determinism, pilot/selection mirror derivation)
  stayed green unchanged; `sim-checksum-baseline` digest was UNCHANGED (its scripted units
  all carry move orders, so the priority set is identical either way); only
  `pilot-handle-equivalence` shifted — exactly the piloted order-less King (K-2) losing
  priority — and its golden was re-blessed (c9d773db… → bb4ef00d…) with the change documented
  inline. The boundary guard still confines sim reads to state.ts + the 6 allowlisted files.

## (original P1-PRE plan, for reference) Sever the last sim READ of a Bucket-C field

`state.ts:~1495` still reads `selectedUnitIds` to seed single-player
movement-priority:

```ts
const isLockstepMatch = commandRouter !== null;
const movementPriorityIds = new Set(
  isLockstepMatch ? Object.keys(draft.unitOrders) : draft.selectedUnitIds
);
```

This is the ONLY place the sim still reads a Bucket-C (main-thread) field. A worker
tick cannot see the main-thread selection, so this must go before the sim moves.
Lockstep already derives priority from `unitOrders`; only single-player still uses
selection. Options:

- **(A) Unify SP onto the lockstep `unitOrders` rule.** One rule everywhere; the sim
  reads only Bucket-A. **Behaviour change in SP:** a *selected but order-less* unit
  loses its "push through idle teammates / royal make-way" priority until it has an
  active order. Simplest, and arguably the better rule. Not visible to the harnesses
  (all lockstep), so it needs a *new* SP-priority harness or a manual check.
- **(B) Feed selection into the worker as an SP-only, non-networked command.** Keeps
  current SP behaviour exactly, but adds selection to the sim's input surface (a new
  command + apply handler) — re-entangles what Phase 0 worked to separate.
- **(C) Compute the priority set on the main thread and pass it with the tick
  message.** SP-only side input to the tick; keeps behaviour, keeps selection out of
  the persistent sim state, but the tick signature grows a per-frame param.

**Recommendation: (A)** — it deletes the coupling outright and matches MP. It is a
deliberate, documented gameplay tweak (no longer a pure refactor), so re-bless the
checksum goldens and add an SP-priority assertion. **Decision needed from the user
before proceeding.**

## P1-1 — Split `useGameStore` into the three stores (§1 of phase 0), still main-thread

Behaviour-neutral cutover, no worker yet — this is the bulk of the line-count and the
riskiest mechanical step, so it lands first and on its own.

> **⚠️ VERIFICATION CONSTRAINT (2026-06-28).** P1-1's risk surface is React rendering
> reactivity across **58 reactive `useGameStore((s)=>…)` subscriptions in 15 files** (vs
> only 6 imperative `getState()` sites, already routed through `getSimSnapshot()`). The
> tsc-driven removal pattern (delete the field from `useGameStore` ⇒ tsc flags every
> consumer) guarantees no consumer is left reading a dead field, but it does NOT prove the
> migrated subscription still *re-renders at the right time* — and this store has a
> documented mutated-in-place reactivity quirk (see the "RTS mutated-state UI trap" memory:
> the tick mutates `units`/`matchStats`/`gameOver` in place and components lean on `units`
> to drive re-renders). Swapping the reactivity substrate from the live mutated store to an
> ingested mirror can perturb exactly those re-render edges. That class of bug is only
> catchable by running the app — and **Playwright/headless-browser verification is disabled
> in this environment** (see "RTS no Playwright verification" memory). So the reactive-sub
> migration must be paired with a manual in-browser pass (or a re-enabled browser check)
> before it can be called done; tsc + the sim harnesses are necessary but not sufficient.

### P1-1 progress — executing as verifiable slices (user chose "cutover, verify in-browser")

- **Slice 1 DONE (placement teardrop) — 2026-06-28.** `unitPlacementCount` /
  `unitPlacementCursor` moved off the sim store onto `useUiStore`. Chosen first because it
  is the smallest fully-main-thread C field (post-T2-D the sim neither reads nor writes it)
  with the most isolated render surface (just the teardrop indicator), so it proves the
  cross-store pattern end-to-end on low risk. The pure teardrop setters
  (`resetUnitPlacement` / `setUnitPlacementCursor`) now live directly on `useUiStore`; the
  two sim-reading orchestrators (`incrementUnitPlacement` / `placeRalliedUnits`) stay on the
  sim store (they read the piloted monarch's followers) but write the `useUiStore` setters.
  Lifecycle resets (initializeGame / startMatch), the pilot/selection handles (clearSelection,
  clearPilot, cycleFireTeam, beginLocalPilot), and the post-tick `syncLocalPilotMirror`
  death-release clear all call `useUiStore.getState().resetUnitPlacement()` cross-store.
  tsc-driven cutover (removed the two fields from the `Store` type ⇒ tsc flagged every
  consumer: UnitPlacementIndicator's 2 reactive subs → `useUiStore`; KeyboardShortcuts +
  GamepadController imperative reads + cursor/reset calls → `useUiStore`). `state.ts`
  re-exports `useUiStore` so the headless harnesses reach the same singleton.
  - **Verified:** tsc + vite build clean; all 8 sim harnesses green (selection-mirror
    derivation updated to drive placement via `useUiStore`). **Rendering NOT browser-verified
    (see constraint above).** → **In-browser checklist for the user:** pilot a King/Queen,
    HOLD the Deploy/rally key → the blue teardrop appears and its number climbs the ladder
    (1,5,10,…); release → that many followers peel off and the teardrop vanishes; on
    controller, hold the cursor-deploy trigger → the teardrop floats over the moving cursor
    and deploys there; deselect / switch monarch / let the piloted monarch die → the teardrop
    disappears immediately.
- **Slice 2 DONE (selectedUnitIds) — 2026-06-28.** The largest reactive surface. Moved
  `selectedUnitIds` + the pure setters `selectUnits` / `addToSelection` onto `useUiStore`.
  Safe because P1-PRE already severed the only sim read of selection, so it is now purely
  main-thread. The sim-reading orchestrators (clearSelection, rallyToMonarch, beginLocalPilot,
  cycleFireTeam, placeRalliedUnits) and the post-tick `syncLocalSelectionMirror` stay in
  state.ts but write the `useUiStore` setters; lifecycle resets (initializeGame / startMatch)
  call `useUiStore.getState().selectUnits([])` cross-store. tsc-driven cutover of all
  consumers:
  - Reactive subs → `useUiStore`: HexInteraction (selectedUnitIds + selectUnits + addToSelection),
    AnimalSelectionButtons, CameraController, BehaviorRadial, DirectingRadial.
  - Imperative reads → `useUiStore.getState().selectedUnitIds`: UnitsLayer (per-frame render
    read + right-click pick), CameraController (auto-follow centroid), GamepadController
    (loneSelectedQueen, cursor command, ability ctx).
  - `selectUnits` callers → `useUiStore`: KeyboardShortcuts (selectByAnimal / selectAll),
    GamepadController (primary-action / select-group / select-all / select-monarch-animal).
  - BehaviorRadial's `behaviorSignature` selector still subscribes to the sim store for
    `units` (re-runs each tick) but reads the selection from the component's `useUiStore`
    closure value, so it stays current with at most one tick of lag — fine for a wheel
    highlight.
  - **Verified:** tsc + vite build clean; all 8 sim harnesses + boundary guard green (the 5
    harnesses that selected units for legacy setup redirected to `useUiStore`; selection no
    longer affects any checksum). **Rendering NOT browser-verified.** → **In-browser checklist:**
    left-click / drag-select units → gold ring + HUD highlight track the selection; right-click
    → the selected army moves/attacks (not the piloted monarch); Shift-click adds; click empty
    ground deselects; the King/Queen selection buttons highlight the piloted monarch; the
    behavior + directing radials highlight the selected units' current postures; camera
    auto-follow eases onto the selection; reinforcements spawned behind a selected monarch join
    the selection.
- **Remaining slices (next):** `pilotedUnitId` / `pilotedFireTeamId` (HUD ring, camera,
  several radials), then `selectedAnimalPool`. `localPlayerId` stays on the sim store (read
  sim-wide; becomes worker config in P1-2). Each slice: same tsc-driven pattern + an
  in-browser pass.

- **Sim module (`state.ts`):** keeps Bucket A + A′ + the tick + all command handlers.
  Becomes "the simulation," unaware of any store split.
- **`useSimMirrorStore` (new, main thread):** holds the per-frame snapshot the UI
  renders from — Bucket A (read-only copy) + the C-mirrors (`selectedUnitIds`,
  `pilotedUnitId`, `pilotedFireTeamId`). Written ONLY by snapshot ingest + the
  `syncLocal*Mirror` derivations.
- **`useUiStore` (exists):** absorbs the remaining C-local fields
  (`unitPlacementCount/cursor`, `localPlayerId`, `matchStartNonce`). D already split
  (`useUiSettingsStore`).
- `getSimSnapshot()` returns `useSimMirrorStore.getState()` instead of the live store;
  the 20+ already-routed read sites change nowhere (they call the accessor).
- Pre-worker, "ingest" is a synchronous `set(simState)` after each tick — so this step
  is provably behaviour-neutral and the full harness suite must stay byte-identical.

## P1-2 — Stand up the worker, sim runs inside it

- New `src/game/sim.worker.ts`: imports the sim module, owns the authoritative state,
  receives `NetCommand`s (+ lifecycle: start/seed/tick-or-run), runs the tick.
- `dispatchCommand` becomes `worker.postMessage({kind:'command', command})`.
- After each tick the worker posts a snapshot; the main thread ingests it into
  `useSimMirrorStore`. Start with `structuredClone` of the sim state (simple, correct);
  optimise to SoA / transferable buffers later (was the §3 "re-point at SoA buffer").
- HexGrid's loop no longer calls `tick()` directly — it pumps the worker (SP fixed
  accumulator → `postMessage('run', n)`; the `syncLocal*Mirror` passes run on ingest).

## P1-3 — Move the sim-side companions INTO the worker (§3 Tier-3)

`ai/aiCommander.ts`, `ai/replayRecorder.ts`, and the lockstep engine glue
(`net/netMatch.ts`, `net/lockstep.ts`) run alongside the tick, so they move worker-side
(they already read sim state and emit commands — no mirror needed). `pilotInput`
sampling stays main-thread and rides the per-frame `pilotMove` command, as today.

## P1-4 — Snapshot perf pass

Replace whole-state cloning with structure-of-arrays transferable buffers for the hot
fields (positions/hp/state), keyed by a stable unit index. This is where the worker
actually pays off (main thread stops doing O(n) sim work each frame).

---

## Verification (unchanged methodology)

Every increment must keep the Phase-0 gates green:
`snapshot-boundary.guard` + `sim-checksum-baseline` + `dispatch-command-equivalence` +
`pilot-handle-equivalence` + `pilot-mirror-derivation` + `selection-mirror-derivation` +
`lockstep-two-peer-determinism` + `lockstep-pilot-determinism`, plus `tsc` + `vite
build`. P1-PRE(A) is the one intentional sim-behaviour change → re-bless the baseline
golden and add an SP movement-priority assertion. The worker steps (P1-2+) need a new
harness that drives the sim THROUGH the worker message bus and asserts the snapshot
trajectory matches the in-thread golden.

Order: P1-PRE → P1-1 → P1-2 → P1-3 → P1-4. P1-1 is the spine; P1-PRE unblocks it.
