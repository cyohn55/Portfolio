<p>For a new college graduate, a well-written resume, cover letter, and diverse portfolio is often an important step for finding a job in the industry. A portfolio website allows developers to highlight coding projects and demonstrates their ability to code a website.</p>
<p>However, in the age of AI, the canonical approach to build a portfolio/blog site is cumbersome, the syntax is verbose, and trivial problems can take an evening or longer to sort out.</p>
<strong><em>AI has now entered the chat</strong></em>
<p>But, not all is doom and gloom with the help of AI. I wanted to create a simple way where I could quickly add new posts to my portfolio without needing to code them by hand. I knew there were plenty of blogging tools available to me, but I wanted to attempt “vibe coding” to get a better understanding of what LLMs are capable of.</p>
<p>For the blog tool, I wanted the ability to draft a new email, include text, images, and video in the body of the email, which would act as an HTML blueprint for building a new web page. The email would trigger a <strong>git push</strong> command, pushing my portfolio website live to my github pages website, once the email is sent.</p>
<h2>Here is how it works:</h2>

<h2>And here is the result:</h2>
<h3>A new blog tile is created on the home page of my portfolio website.</h3>

<h3>Which, links to the newly created web page.</h3>
