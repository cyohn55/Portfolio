    <h1>Notable Achievements</h1>
    <ul class="achievements-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Solution Architect: <i>I lobbied for a data integration project at EnergyPricing.com that combined customer data from Excel, internal documents, and accounting data via Salesforce, ensuring data integrity and increasing sales.</i></strong>
            Prior to my lobbying efforts, the company did not have processes in place for data management. 
            As a result, data was stored in several areas. 
            Duplicate customer accounts were created during previous Salesforce uploads, which caused our sales team to accidentally call the same customer twice or more on the same day.
            
            <p>To solve this issue, we needed to integrate customer account data, signed contracts, call logs, accounting data, and more into a single-parent account within Salesforce. 
            The parent account would act as the central repository for all data related to a customer. 
            During the integration process, we were able to clean redundancies created from previous Salesforce uploads and provide structure to our data by grouping customers by billing address.</p>
            <p><strong><i>Also, since we could quote a client's electric accounts in aggregate, we could secure a lower wholesale rate from our energy supply partners, making our pricing more attractive to customers and our sales team more effective at closing deals.</i></strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Automation Engineer: <i>I automated my workflow in my role as a pricing analyst for EnergyPricing.com.</i></strong>
            I created a request for pricing (RFP) spreadsheet in Excel that contained a list of customer accounts. 
            We would send this list to our electric supply partners to request pricing for our electric supply customers. 
            <strong><i>I didn't know how to program at the time, but I was able to hack together a spreadsheet that automated my workflow using Visual Basic, Excel Macros, and Microsoft Outlook.</i></strong>
            The Excel spreadsheet had a macro button for each supplier that created a new email, attached the correct RFP, typed the recipient's email address, name, pre-canned message, and subject line. 
            From here, I could edit the email before sending it to one of our supply partners. 
            After receiving several bids from our supply partners and compiling the pricing and savings data, I sent the completed quote to our sales team. 
            <strong><i>The spreadsheet reduced the turnaround time for a quote from 30-45 minutes to 10-15 minutes.</i></strong>
